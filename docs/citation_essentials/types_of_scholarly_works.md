### Book series

A series is an ongoing collection of independent works, often written by different authors or research teams and brought together under a broadly defined theme or institutional framework. Its individual volumes are typically not published on a fixed schedule. They are most often monographs or edited collections that vary in scope and focus, each with its own standalone title.
